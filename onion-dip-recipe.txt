2 pouches Onion Soup Mix
1 container sour cream (fat-free is optional)
1 container cottage cheese (optional, but it gives that chunky texture)

Pour the sour cream (and cottage cheese, if you want) into a large bowl.
Pour the contents of the onion soup mix into the bowl.
Mix them well until the contents have a light brown color to them (no traces of white).
Place the bowl in the fridge to chill for 1-2 hours.
Enjoy!
